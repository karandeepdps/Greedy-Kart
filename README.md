## Agents find the shortest path using the greedy approach



SAC is well known to have good exploration ability due to the entropy term in the objective function. Motivated by this, in this paper, a SAC-based path planning algorithm is proposed.

In this experiment, we will see that agents will explore and exploit their behavior.

## Environment

After 100000 steps agents learns to take the shortest path.
